# HelloWorld

This application was generated by the link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugfun.html#_ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype[helloworld archetype].
It is intended as a starting point to learn what Apache Isis is all about.


== Quick start

Build using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

Run using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn jetty:run
----

Login using: 

* username: `sven`
* password: `pass`

The app runs with HSQLDB running in-memory.

== Reproduce issue
* Start app
* Create a Contributee Object using the menu item `Create` in `Contributee Objects`. This will show the desired action.
* Create a Hello World Object using the menu item `Create` in `Hello World Objects`. This will fail because the app calls the disableXxx() method for the contributed action to be rendered at the created (and returned) object's page.
